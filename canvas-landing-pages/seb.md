## About

Welcome to the introductory module on Python, designed for learners with a background in JavaScript. This module is structured with the assumption that learners possess a foundational understanding of coding and programming principles.

Throughout this module, learners will engage in an in-depth exploration of Python's unique features, understanding how they align with and differ from JavaScript. The focus will be on recognizing the key distinctions between Python and JavaScript, applying fundamental Python syntax, and translating common JavaScript concepts into Python constructs.
