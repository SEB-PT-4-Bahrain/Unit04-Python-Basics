## Setup

Open your Terminal application and navigate to your **`~/code/ga/lectures`** directory:

```bash
cd ~/code/ga/lectures
```

Make a new directory called **`intro_to_python`**, then enter this directory:

```bash
mkdir intro_to_python
cd intro_to_python
```

Then create an `intro_to_python.py` file with:

```bash
touch intro_to_python.py
```

A quick note on convention - you'll note that we're using underscores (`_`) in this filename/directory instead of dashes (`-`). This follows the [PEP style guide](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#package-and-module-names) for python modules and packages.

Open the contents of the directory in VSCode:

```bash
code .
```
